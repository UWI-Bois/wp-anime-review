With the SiteGround Optimizer enabled, you're getting the very best from your hosting environment!

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to link WordPress with the SiteGround Performance services. It WILL NOT WORK on another hosting provider. 

The SG Optimizer plugin has few different parts handling speciffic performance optimizations:

== Configuration ==

For detailed information on our plugin and how it works, please check out our [SG Optimizer Tutorial](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/sg-optimizer/ "SG Optimizer Tutorial").


= SuperCacher Settings = 

In this tab, you can configure your Dynamic Caching and Memcached. Make sure you've enabled them from your cPanel before using the plugin. You can enable/disable the automatic cache purge, exclude URLs from the cache and test your pages if they are properly cached.

= Environment Optimization = 

Here, you can force HTTPS for your site, switch between different PHP Versions (compatibility check available), and enable or disable Gzip Compression and Borwser Caching rules for your site.

= Frontend Optimization =

In this tab, you can enable or disable Minification of your HTML, JS and CSS resources, remove the Emoji support and remove the query strings from your static resources.

= Image Optimization = 

Here, you can enable or disable optimization for your newly uploaded images, bulk optimize your old ones and enable lazy loading for your site images.

= Plugin Compatibility =

If your plugin does not trigger standard WordPress hooks or you need us to purge the cache, you can use this public function in your code:

	if (function_exists('sg_cachepress_purge_cache')) {
		sg_cachepress_purge_cache();
	}

Preferrably, you can pass an URL to the function to clear the cache just for it instead of purging the entire cache. For example:

	if (function_exists('sg_cachepress_purge_cache')) {
		sg_cachepress_purge_cache('https://yoursite.com/pluginpage');
	}

You can exclude styles from being combined and minified using the filters we’ve designed for that purpose. Here’s an example of the code, you can add to your functions.php file:

	add_filter( 'sgo_css_combine_exclude', 'css_combine_exclude' );
	function css_combine_exclude( $exclude_list ) {
		// Add the style handle to exclude list.
		$exclude_list[] = 'style-handle';
		$exclude_list[] = 'style-handle-2';

		return $exclude_list;
	}

	add_filter( 'sgo_css_minify_exclude', 'css_minify_exclude' );
	function css_minify_exclude( $exclude_list ) {
		// Add the style handle to exclude list.
		$exclude_list[] = 'style-handle';
		$exclude_list[] = 'style-handle-2';

		return $exclude_list;
	}

You can exclude script from being minified using the filter we’ve designed for that purpose. Here’s an example of the code, you can add to your functions.php file:

	add_filter( 'sgo_js_minify_exclude', 'js_minify_exclude' );
	function js_minify_exclude( $exclude_list ) {
		$exclude_list[] = 'script-handle';
		$exclude_list[] = 'script-handle-2';

		return $exclude_list;
	}

You can exclude script from being loaded asynchronous using the filter we’ve designed for that purpose. Here’s an example of the code, you can add to your functions.php file:

	add_filter( 'sgo_js_async_exclude', 'js_async_exclude' );
	function js_async_exclude( $exclude_list ) {
		$exclude_list[] = 'script-handle';
		$exclude_list[] = 'script-handle-2';

		return $exclude_list;
	}

You can exclude url or url that contain specific query param using the following filters:

	add_filter( 'sgo_html_minify_exclude_params', 'html_minify_exclude_params' );
	function html_minify_exclude_params( $exclude_params ) {
		// Add the query params that you want to exclude.
		$exclude_params[] = 'test';

		return $exclude_params;
	}

	add_filter( 'sgo_html_minify_exclude_urls', 'html_minify_exclude' );
	function html_minify_exclude( $exclude_urls ) {
		// Add the url that you want to exclude.
		$exclude_urls[] = 'http://mydomain.com/page-slug';

		return $exclude_urls;
	}

You can exclude images from Lazy Load using the following filter:

	add_filter( 'sgo_lazy_load_exclude_classes', 'exclude_images_with_specific_class' );
	function exclude_images_with_specific_class( $classes ) {
		// Add the class name that you want to exclude from lazy load.
		$classes[] = 'test-class';

		return $classes;
	}

= WP-CLI Support =

= Requirements =

In order to work correctly, this plugin requires that your server meets the following criteria:

* SiteGround account
* WordPress 4.7
* PHP 5.5
* If you're not hosted with SiteGround this plugin WILL NOT WORK  because it relies on a specific server configuration

Our plugin uses a cookie in order to function properly. It does not store personal data and is used solely for the needs of our caching system.
